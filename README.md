# mutt_configuration

Interactive configuration of the highly configurable mail client Mutt, to access GMail via IMAP.

Actually only for the french version of GMail.
Cause, the name of the directory int IMAP protocol are translated in french :(

## Note

To avoid some problems on Raspberry Pi to see the html in the browser, run the folowing command to
install some missing fonts. Because Chromium will generate the html in the directory /tmp and open it
in the browser.

```sh  
sudo apt-get install fonts-ipafont-gothic xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi xfonts-cyrillic
```
